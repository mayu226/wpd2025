        Early life
                  Virat Kohli was born on 5 November 1988 in Delhi into a Punjabi Hindu family. His father, Prem Nath Kohli, worked as a criminal
        lawyer, and his mother, Saroj Kohli, served as a housewife. He has an older brother, Vikas, and an older sister, Bhawna.[12] Kohli's 
        formative years were spent in Uttam Nagar. He commenced his early education at Vishal Bharti Public School.[13] According to his family, 
        Kohli exhibited an early affinity for cricket as a three-year-old. He would pick up a cricket bat and request his father bowl to him.[14]

                 In 1998, the West Delhi Cricket Academy (WDCA) was created. On 30 May of that year, Prem Nath Kohli arranged for his son to meet Rajkumar
        Sharma.[15] Upon the suggestion of their neighbours, Kohli's father considered enrolling his son in a professional cricket academy, as they
        believed that his cricketing abilities merited more than just playing in gully cricket.[16] Despite his abilities, he faced the setback of
        being unable to secure a place in the under-14 Delhi team, supposedly due to extraneous factors. Prem Kohli reportedly received offers to
        relocate his son to influential clubs, which would have ensured his selection, but he declined the proposals. Kohli eventually found his way
        into the under-15 Delhi team.[17] He received training at the academy while simultaneously participating in matches at the Sumeet Dogra
        Academy located at Vasundhara Enclave.[18] In pursuit of furthering his cricketing career, he transitioned to Saviour Convent School during 
        his ninth-grade education.[16]

                  On 18 December 2006, Kohli's father died due to a cerebral attack.[16][19][13][20] According to his mother, Kohli's demeanour 
        shifted noticeably after his father's death. He took cricket with newfound seriousness, prioritizing playing time and dedicating himself 
        fully to the sport.[16] Kohli's family resided in Meera Bagh, Paschim Vihar until the year 2015, after which they relocated to Gurgaon.[21]</p>
