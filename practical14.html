       <p> Piece of rubber or other material used to rub out marks made by ink,
        pencil, or chalk. The modern eraser is usually a mixture of an abrasive such
        as fine pumice, a rubbery matrix such as synthetic rubber or vinyl, and other
        ingredients.An eraser (also known as a rubber in some Commonwealth countries,
        including South Africa[1][2][3] from which the material first used got its name
        ) is an article of stationery that is used for removing marks from paper or skin 
        (e.g. parchment or vellum). Erasers have a rubbery consistency and come in a
        variety of shapes, sizes, and colors. Some pencils have an eraser on one end.
        Erasers can come in various shapes and colors. Less expensive erasers are made
        from synthetic rubber and synthetic soy-based gum, but more expensive or
        specialized erasers are made from vinyl, plastic, or gum-like materials.</p>
